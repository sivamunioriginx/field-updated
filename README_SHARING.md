# 📱 Sharing Your APKs Without a Server

## The Problem
You want to share your Customer and Worker APKs with a friend, but you don't have:
- ❌ A domain name
- ❌ A hosted server
- ❌ Cloud hosting

## The Solution ✅
Use **ngrok** to expose your local backend to the internet temporarily!

---

## 🎯 Three Ways to Do This

### Method 1: Super Easy (Recommended)
**One-click start everything:**
```bash
start-for-sharing.bat
```
This starts backend + ngrok, then builds APKs automatically!

### Method 2: Quick Start (5 steps)
See: `QUICK_START_SHARING.md`
- Install ngrok
- Start backend
- Start ngrok
- Build APKs
- Share!

### Method 3: Full Manual Control
See: `SHARE_APKS_GUIDE.md`
- Detailed step-by-step guide
- Troubleshooting tips
- Alternative options

## 🚀 Fastest Way (For Windows)

1. **Install ngrok** (one-time setup):
   - Go to https://ngrok.com/download
   - Sign up and download
   - Authenticate: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN`

2. **Double-click** `start-for-sharing.bat`
   - Starts backend automatically
   - Starts ngrok automatically
   - Prompts you to build APKs

3. **Copy ngrok URL** and paste when asked

4. **Wait for builds** to complete

5. **Share APKs** from `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`

**That's it!** 🎉

## 💡 How It Works

```
Your Friend's Phone 📱

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free ngrok Limitations:
- URL changes when you restart ngrok
- If URL changes → rebuild APKs with new URL
- 2-hour session timeout (just restart it)

### Your Responsibilities:
- Keep computer powered on
- Don't close terminal windows
- Maintain internet connection
- Let friend know when you're available

### Friend's Responsibilities:
- Enable "Unknown Sources" on Android
- Have internet connection
