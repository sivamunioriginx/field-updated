## 🎓 Understanding ngrok

Friend's Phone → Internet → ngrok → Your Computer → Backend → Database
```

### Is it free?
Yes! Free tier includes:
- ✅ HTTPS URLs

- ⚠️ 40 connections/minute

### Should you upgrade?
For testing with friends: **No, free is fine**
For serious use: **Yes, or deploy properly**
