# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## ðŸ“± Sharing APKs Without a Server

Want to share your APKs with friends using only your local backend? **It's possible!**

### ðŸš€ Quick Start (One Command)
```bash
start-for-sharing.bat
```
This automatically starts backend + ngrok, then builds APKs!

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- **[README_SHARING.md](./README_SHARING.md)** - Overview & quick reference
- **[QUICK_START_SHARING.md](./QUICK_START_SHARING.md)** - 5-minute setup guide
- **[SHARE_APKS_GUIDE.md](./SHARE_APKS_GUIDE.md)** - Complete detailed guide

### ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
1. Use **ngrok** to expose your local backend to the internet
2. Build APKs with the ngrok URL
3. Share APKs with friends
4. Keep your computer on while they use the app

Perfect for testing and demos! ðŸŽ‰
